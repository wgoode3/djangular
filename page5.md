Let's start with an existing Angular frontend [click to download](https://github.com/wgoode3/djangular/raw/master/assets/client.zip) and let us replace our existing client folder with this. Build out the backend with restful routes to create, read, update, and delete tasks. 

<strong>Bonus Challenge:</strong> Alter the client code to display validation errors.

<strong>Hacker Challenge:</strong> Alter the client code to also use [front end validations](https://angular.io/guide/form-validation).
